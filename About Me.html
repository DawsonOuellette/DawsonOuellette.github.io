			<p>I am a passionate musician who has specialized in drum-set/percussion
for nearly a decade. In addition, I have took up other instuments such
as bass guitar, electrick Guitar, and keyboard. Over the years I learned
the importance of having a musical mentor and I have taken professional 
instruction for the last seven years (and still going). Ever since I started
learning from my mentor, my progress accelerated and this event has 
inspired me to help others acheive the same results.</p>
